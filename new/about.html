		  </h1>

				<p>
					<hr>
					<br>
					I am a 15 year old from Canada, and I am currently going to high school. My goal program for university is Software Engineering at University of Waterloo. Although I do enjoy coding, I am still quite new to it, so it would be nice if you have any constructive critisism for my website, as I am still learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Things I do other than coding is play piano in my spare time. I am currently preparing my ARCT piano exams for the Royal Conservatory, and I did my level 10 piano exam during the summer of 2020. Because I am still a human, I do enjoy other things such as light novels, sleeping, watching anime, and the occasional game.

				Piano

				I started playing piano when I was 6 or 7. I am not very talented at piano, so it took me around 6-7 years to do my level 10 piano exams. Although it took me a long time only to do level 10, I don't try to play piano for the sake of just playing it, I am currently trying to make piano a full on hobby as in when I have free time, I might just start playing piano.

			Swimming
		</h1>
		<p>
			<hr>
			<br>
			I started competative swimming when I was very young. Although I started young, I never had an affinity or enjoyed it until my final years of the sport. Some achievements I got in swimming was to qualify for Festivals multiple times and qualifying for the OYJs meet (Ontario Youth Junior). In my final year of swimming, there was COVID-19, and I got a concussion, so I had to finish early, but my breaststroke times still held for top 30 in Canada for my age group.
