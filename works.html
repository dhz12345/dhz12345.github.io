        <h1>Personal Website</h1>
        <p>
            This project will be forever on going. You may think you do not know what this project is, but let me assure
            you, you do know. Infact, you are looking at it right now. This project is for me to learn web development
            and for me to share things about myself, from my hobbies, to my projects. This website will provide my
            contact information, my personal hobbies and skills, and my side projects.

        <h1>Personal C++ Calculator</h1>
        <p>
            This project will be forever on going just like my website. This project is to give myself all the functions
            I need in a calculator. Whenever I don't want to google the answer for an equation anymore, I'll add it into
            this calculator so it'll make my own life easier. This is also a basic C++ console program, so that means no
            graphics or whatnot, which makes it fast and lightweight to run. So far this calculator can do basic
            operations and other things such as finder the power of x, which number is smaller, which number is larger,
            prime factoring, solving for the hypotenuse, finding the remainder of any number, rounding numbers and
            square root of the number.
